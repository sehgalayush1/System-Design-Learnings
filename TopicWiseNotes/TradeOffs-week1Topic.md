Excellent question, Ahmed — and yes, **these are the most common categories** of trade-offs you’ll encounter in system design. But depending on the **domain (e.g., financial systems, IoT, real-time games, ML platforms)**, there **can be many other trade-offs** too.

Let me first recap the **common, near-universal ones** you already saw, and then expand with **lesser-known but equally important trade-offs** with real-world examples.

### ✅ **The Usual Trade-Offs (Nearly Always Relevant)**

| Trade-off                                     | Explained                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost vs Performance**                       | Faster infra = higher cost                                             |
| **Consistency vs Availability** (CAP theorem) | Block reads to get latest data, or serve stale but be highly available |
| **Simplicity vs Extensibility**               | One quick design vs future-proof modular system                        |
| **Scalability vs Consistency**                | Sharded systems scale better but may sacrifice consistency             |
| **Latency vs Reliability**                    | Retrying, replication adds reliability but slows response              |
| **Durability vs Cost**                        | Geo-replicated data is safer but expensive                             |
| **Maintainability vs Optimization**           | Highly optimized systems are often complex and fragile                 |

These are the **most assessed ones in interviews**, especially at FAANG or top product companies.

## 🔍 🔄 **More Trade-Offs You’ll Encounter in the Wild**

### 🔄 **Throughput vs Latency**

* **Throughput** = how many requests per second you can handle.
* **Latency** = how fast you can respond to each request.
* Improving one often hurts the other.
* **Example:** Batching API calls improves throughput (e.g., send 100 images at once), but increases latency per image.

---

### 🧠 **Accuracy vs Speed (in ML or real-time analytics systems)**

* In fraud detection or search, you often trade **model complexity** (for accuracy) with **inference speed**.
* **Example:** Fast autocomplete uses fuzzy heuristics, not full ML relevance scoring — it’s okay to be “close enough” fast, rather than 100% precise but slow.

---

### 🕹️ **Responsiveness vs Power Efficiency (in mobile / IoT)**

* Background polling drains battery.
* **Example:** Messaging apps like WhatsApp balance real-time delivery vs waking the app too often, which kills battery.

---

### 🌍 **Global Consistency vs Local Experience**

* If you replicate your app across regions, you may see **stale state** in one region vs another.
* **Example:** A like on a Facebook post may show up a few seconds later to your friend abroad.
* Tradeoff: either strong global ordering (expensive + slow) or faster localized writes (but eventual consistency).

---

### 💾 **Preprocessing vs On-Demand Computation**

* Should you **pre-compute** (e.g., analytics dashboards, search indexes) or **compute on-the-fly**?
* **Precompute** → fast access, but high storage + inflexibility.
* **On-demand** → flexible, but slower.
* **Example:** YouTube caches trending videos and their metadata. But your private watch stats are fetched live.

---

### 🧩 **Flexibility vs Schema Enforcement**

* Schema-less (e.g., MongoDB) gives flexibility, but you lose data guarantees.
* Rigid schema (e.g., PostgreSQL) gives strong guarantees, but less agility.
* **Example:** A startup might begin with DynamoDB (flexible). But as business rules grow, they might migrate to Postgres for data integrity.

---

### 🛡️ **Security vs Usability**

* The stricter the access, the more secure — but harder for users to use.
* **Example:** Banking apps require OTP, biometric, etc., while meme-sharing apps allow instant access.
* You must tune security according to the value of the system.

---

### 🔐 **Encryption vs Speed**

* Encrypting everything end-to-end slows performance (adds CPU cycles).
* **Example:** End-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal have higher overheads than regular chat apps.
* Decide where encryption is absolutely necessary.

---

### 🧪 **Testing Rigor vs Deployment Speed**

* Writing comprehensive integration tests slows time-to-market, but ensures fewer bugs.
* Some teams prefer CI/CD pipelines with light testing + rollback mechanisms.
* This is a **DevOps trade-off**, often organization-dependent.

### 👨‍🏫 In Interviews: Use Trade-Off Language Like This

When you're asked, "Would you precompute image thumbnails or generate on demand?" → say:

> *If thumbnails are needed frequently (e.g., gallery preview), I'd precompute and store them, trading off storage cost for fast access. If thumbnails are rarely used or vary dynamically (e.g., image filters), I'd compute on-demand to save storage at the cost of CPU.*
