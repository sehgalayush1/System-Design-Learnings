Absolutely! Here's a **condensed notes version** of everything I explained above, along with the **new concepts you asked** about‚Äîconsistency in DBs, polling vs event-driven, and normalization.

## üîñ **Cheat Sheet / Notes**

### 1. **Asynchronous Message Queuing**

* **What:** Decouple producer and consumer using a queue. Instead of doing everything right now, the system puts the work in a queue (like a todo list). Then another part of the system (called a "worker") picks it up later and does the job.
* **Example:** AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
* **Why:** Improves scalability and reliability.

### 2. **Pub-Sub Architecture**

* **What:** One service publishes a message, many services subscribe to act on it. Each acts on the same message independently. If one fails, others are unaffected.
* **Example:** SNS, Kafka.
* **Why:** Allows multiple systems to react independently to the same event.
üñ•Ô∏è In system design:
OTP service publishes: "Send this OTP to +91xxxx".
Different subscribers might be:
Email sender service
SMS sender service
Logging system
Analytics tracker

### 3. **Tiered Routing with Bulk Providers**

* **What:** Use cheaper or fallback SMS/Email providers based on rules. Route messages to different vendors based on cost, performance, or region.
* **Why:** Cost-effective and resilient.
* **Example:** Try MSG91, fallback to Twilio if MSG91 fails.


### 4. **Rate Limiting**

* **What:** Limit number of requests per user/time period.
* **Why:** Prevent abuse, protect services.

### 5. **Retries with Exponential Backoff**

* **What:** Retry failed actions after increasing delays.
* **Why:** Avoids retry storms and allows system recovery.
* **Example Delays:** 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s.

### 6. **DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)**

* **What:** Separate queue for messages that repeatedly fail.
* **Why:** Prevents system from being stuck on bad data.

### 7. **Stateless Workers**

* **What:** Workers that don‚Äôt store state across jobs.
* **Why:** Easy to scale horizontally.
* **Example:** Lambda functions picking OTP jobs from SQS.

### 8. **Failover Mechanism**

* **What:** Backup systems that take over on failure to ensure availability.
* **Why:** Ensure availability.
* **Example:** Use load balancers, health checks, and multi-region deployments.

## üß† **What is a Consistent Database?**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

A **consistent database** ensures **strong data correctness** ‚Äî the data you read is always **up-to-date** and reflects the latest committed write.

### üß± Examples:

* **Strongly Consistent:**

  * **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **Oracle**, **MongoDB (w/ write concern: majority)**.
* **Eventually Consistent (by default):**

  * **DynamoDB**, **Cassandra**, **Redis (clustered)**, **S3**

### üßÆ **How are they consistent?**

* Use **ACID Transactions** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
* Use **write-ahead logs**, **replication logs**, and **quorum acknowledgments**.

### üîç How to know?

* Look at documentation ‚Üí look for terms like:

  * **‚Äústrong consistency‚Äù**, **‚Äúeventual consistency‚Äù**
  * **‚Äúreplication guarantees‚Äù**, **‚Äúread-your-write‚Äù**.

## üîÑ **Polling vs Event-Driven Architecture**

### üï∞Ô∏è 1. **Polling**

| Aspect      | Explanation                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| What        | System repeatedly checks if something has changed. |
| Example     | Every 10s, check DB for new OTPs to send.          |
| When to use | Simple use cases, where real-time is not critical. |
| Drawback    | Wastes resources; introduces delay.                |

### üîî 2. **Event-Driven**

| Aspect      | Explanation                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| What        | System reacts **immediately** to events.                  |
| Example     | A message added to a queue triggers a Lambda to send OTP. |
| When to use | Real-time, scalable systems.                              |
| Benefit     | Efficient, decoupled, fast.                               |

### üß† Rule of Thumb:

> ‚ÄúUse **polling** for simplicity and low-frequency tasks. Use **event-driven** for real-time systems with unpredictable loads.‚Äù

## üß± **Database Normalization**

### ‚úÖ **What is it?**

A technique to **organize DB tables to reduce redundancy** and improve **data integrity**.

### üìö Common Normal Forms:

1. **1NF**: No repeating groups or arrays in a row.
2. **2NF**: Every non-key column depends on **the full primary key**.
3. **3NF**: No **transitive dependencies** ‚Äî i.e., data depends only on primary key.

### üîÑ Denormalization:

* Combine tables for **faster reads** in read-heavy systems.
* Common in data warehouses, caching systems.
