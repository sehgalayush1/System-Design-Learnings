## 1. Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Principles

*   **SOLID Principles:**
    *   **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
        *   (Your notes here: Definition, examples, benefits)
    *   **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
        *   (Your notes here: Definition, examples, benefits)
    *   **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
        *   (Your notes here: Definition, examples, benefits)
    *   **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
        *   (Your notes here: Definition, examples, benefits)
    *   **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
        *   (Your notes here: Definition, examples, benefits)
*   **Other Key Principles:**
    *   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
        *   (Your notes here)
    *   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
        *   (Your notes here)
    *   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):**
        *   (Your notes here)
    *   **Composition over Inheritance:**
        *   (Your notes here: Explanation, benefits, when to use)
    *   **Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge):**

## 2. Core Design Patterns (Gang of Four - GoF)

For each pattern, try to understand:
*   The problem it solves.
*   Its structure (key classes/interfaces and their relationships).
*   Common use cases.
*   Pros and Cons.

*   **Creational Patterns:**
    *   **Singleton:**
        *   Problem:
        *   Structure:
        *   Use Cases:
        *   Pros/Cons:
