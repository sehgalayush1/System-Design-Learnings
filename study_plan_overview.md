# System Design Interview Preparation: 3-Week Plan

**Overall Approach:**
*   **Daily Study:** Dedicate a consistent amount of time each day.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just read. Draw diagrams for HLD, write pseudo-code or actual class structures for LLD.
*   **Problem Solving:** Tackle at least one HLD and one LLD problem every few days.
*   **Iterate:** Review your designs. What could be improved? What are the trade-offs?
*   **Mock Interviews:** If possible, do mock interviews, especially in the final week.
